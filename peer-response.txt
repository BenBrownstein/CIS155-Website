 The return to top link on the home page is a bit challenging to read
 The text you have towards the bottom of the screen, you choose a lighter text color

 Based on the feedback I got I changed around the CSS for my home page to make bottom section more visable the footer was hard to see as well as the links I did so by changing around the colors for those parts.
 I had to add a class to the footer as the color did not change without it.
